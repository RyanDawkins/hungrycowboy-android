 * This file is to ensure the integrity of the factory directory
  - Files that fall into the factory directory should keep to the factory pattern, it is specified by a factory object extending the object that it is creating instances of. The purpose is to keep the method that the objects are created seperate from the objects they are creating so that the remain modular components we can easily move to other applications.
  - For any questions see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern
